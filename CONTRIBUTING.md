# Contributing to Krypton
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/suyash-chavan/krypton/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/suyash-chavan/krypton/issues/new/) it's that easy!

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
We use ESLint for enforcing standard code. [Here](https://github.com/suyash-chavan/krypton/blob/main/.eslintrc.json) is its configuration file.

## License
